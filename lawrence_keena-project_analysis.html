		<h1>Web Standard Project</h1>
		<h2>Project Analysis</h2>
		<h3>Site Intent</h3>
			<p>The objective of the Christ Episcopal Church website redesign is to provide
			structural organization and focus on the usability of the target audience.  I
			was also able to find that there are 52 errors and 8 warnings when I ran the 
			HTML code through two validators.  The code will need to be cleaned up as well.
			Organization and usability will be achieved by adding navigation to the site,
			cleaning up the basic structure of the site and reducing some content.</p>
			
		<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
			<p>Taking a look at Christianity and Church related sites, there is a high rate of 
			competition out there.
			It is mainly a competition of the different denominations and Church locations.  
			
		    I was able to find that more sites in this category are getting more hits a day, customers 
		    are staying on their page longer and they are pulling in the majority of the 25-34 year
		    old audience.</p>
		<h3>Website Statistics:</h3>    
		    <ul>
		    	<li>There are currently no statistics available as to how long the average user
		    	stays on a Chrisitan/Church organization website.</li>
		    	<li>There are currently nine sites linking to christchurchseattle.org.</li>
		    	<li>No data currently available for audience.</li>
		    	<li>No information available on how many page views there are per day.</li>
		    </ul>
		<h3>Key Words and Search Queries</h3>
			<p>Keywords and search queries that are on the rise and generating more traffic for 
			this site and it's local competition are:
			Seattle christ church and christian churches in seattle. "Churches in seattle"
			is currently the most popular search query.</p>  
		<h3>Targeted Audience</h3>
			<p>I wasn't able to find any specific information on the audience from the site from
			alexa.com, but I was able to analyze other sites in this category and some of the 
			competition.  The average vistor is in the 25-34 year old age range.  Most of the
			visitors are typically women.  I would expect that as far as workflow goes, these
			visitors are here to either learn about the congregation because they are looking for a 
			new church to attend or they are already members of the church.  Members of the church
			would be most likely looking for information such as church event information, 
			using the directory to find fellow church members telephone numbers or to check up 
			on church news and prayer lists.  New visitors would be looking for church service 
			hours, information about the church and services, location and directions and possibly
			contact information to get in touch with the pastor.</p>
