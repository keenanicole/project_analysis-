		<h1>Web Standard Project</h1>
		<h2>Project Analysis</h2>
		<h2>Site Intent<h2>
			<p>The objective of the Christ Episcopal Church website redesign is to provide
			structural organization and focus on the usability of the target audience.  I
			was also able to find that there are 52 errors and 8 warnings when I ran the 
			HTML code through two validators.  The code will need to be cleaned up as well.
			Organization and usability will be achieved by adding navigation to the site,
			cleaning up the basic structure of the site and reducing some content.</p>
